In this script, we're using the faker library to generate random unique order IDs and dates. used Python's built-in random
module to randomly select products from a pre-defined list and generate random quantities.
The product prices are generated using the numpy module's uniform function,
which generates random floating-point numbers in a given range.

This script will create a CSV file with 100 rows of fake sales data and save it as 'sales_data.csv'.
You can then use this CSV file for testing and learning purposes.
